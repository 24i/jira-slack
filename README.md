This is a JIRA-Slack integration, it does the following:

* Sends summaries of issues to your selected channel
* Sends summaries of issues to Slack channels mapped to JIRA projects
* Links to the issues on your JIRA location
* Links mail adresses to the issue creator and assignee

## Install and Run

Run the following things to install:

```
git clone git@github.com:24i/jira-slack.git
cd jira-slack
npm install

# set your env variables
export JIRA_URL=https://your-jira-location.atlassian.net
export SLACK_HOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/HOOK-PARAMS

npm start
```

This will run the integration server and you can now add it as a JIRA WebHook

## Environment variables
You can set the env variables by creating your own .env file (by renaming the .env.sample file) or by setting them yourself in your environment (such as Heroku).

### Required variables
* `JIRA_URL` - The location of your JIRA installation (either your own or cloud)
* `SLACK_HOOK_URL` - The incoming slack hook URL generated by slack

### Optional variables
You can map your JIRA projects to specific Slack channels if you want. Add a variable in the following format: `JIRA_SLACK_PROJECT_EX=my-slack-channel` (where `EX` is your JIRA project key). Messages for these projects will end up in their respective channel.

## Running tests
Running the tests is easy as pie, just run the following command `npm test` and it'll run all of the tests for you
